        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            Online, I have 2 names. Most often I go by Wowiee, but you will ocasionally find me as BlueShark95.<br>
            I'm still a student currently. I'm studying Computer Science, with a specialisation in Cybersecurity. I participate in CTFs here and there. I don't have a permanent team.<br><br>
            Aside from that I also like computers (surprisingly). I have a soft spot for old tech, especially old laptops. I have a little collection of them in my room. No, I'm not a hoarder.<br><br>
            I draw sometimes. My preferred medium is digital.<br><br>
            If you'd like to contact me, you can do so by messaging me on Discord: Wowiee#1510.<br> Alternatively, you can reach me by email: wowieezow@gmail.com
